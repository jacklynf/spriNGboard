It took me a while to figure out why the values were consistently different at smaller index increments compared to append 
in dynamic array. But after our session tonight I now know it's because the deque allocates small chunks at a time. It's 
also interesting to see how much quicker it is to allocate these small chunks than to double the dynamic array size when 
you get to large values... the deque seems to be averaging somewhere above 100ns whereas creating the new vector toward 
the end of the 10,000 iterations took over 30,000ns (and one run took 100,000+ ns).
