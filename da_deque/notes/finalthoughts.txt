I feel like I'm cheating because I'm writing this after our session and we learned how deque allocates its buffers... but I will say that prior to tonight, I had zero experience working with deques so I would have had to do a lot of digging to understand why it was consistently, and more frequently, taking smaller amounts of time to create more space as compared to the dynamic array. I would have thought they would take similar time, but now I know that they don't because deque uses a different method for allocating more space.
