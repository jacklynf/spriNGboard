Rather than changing any of the commands, I decided to just change
some aesthetic features of tmux which would make it more apparent
that a tmux session is active. So, I modified the pane border and
terminal window colors, and just for fun changed the color of the 
status bar.

setw -g pane-border-style fg=magenta,bg=black
setw -g pane-active-border-style fg=white,bg=yellow
setw -g window-style fg=colour7,bg=colour23
set -g message-style fg=white,bold,bg=colour56
set -g status-bg magenta
